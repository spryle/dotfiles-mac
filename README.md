# dotfiles-mac

macOS counterpart to my [Omarchy dotfiles](https://github.com/spryle/dotfiles) —
getting as close to the Hyprland/Linux ricing experience as macOS allows.

## Stack

| Linux (Omarchy) | macOS equivalent | Package dir |
|---|---|---|
| Hyprland (WM) | **AeroSpace** (tiling WM, no SIP changes) | `aerospace/` |
| Waybar | **SketchyBar** | `sketchybar/` |
| Hyprland borders | **JankyBorders** | `borders/` |
| Alacritty / terminal | **WezTerm** | `wezterm/` |
| walker / launcher | **Raycast** (`Option+Space`, set in-app) | — |
| wallpaper | `legacy-mountains.png` (set by install) | `wallpapers/` |
| (Touch Bar) | **BetterTouchTool** — live tappable workspaces | `btt/` |
| starship prompt | **starship** | `starship/` |

Theme: **Catppuccin Mocha**. Font: **JetBrainsMono Nerd Font**.
Raycast theme: Catppuccin Mocha via https://themes.ray.so (needs Raycast Pro).

## Install

```sh
git clone <this-repo> ~/sz/dotfiles-mac && cd ~/sz/dotfiles-mac
./install.sh
```

`install.sh` (idempotent) installs all deps via Homebrew, stows the packages,
wires starship into `~/.zshrc`, and starts the services. Then grant AeroSpace
Accessibility permission when prompted — see the script's closing notes.

AeroSpace auto-starts JankyBorders and notifies SketchyBar of workspace changes.

<details><summary>Manual install (what install.sh does)</summary>

```sh
brew install stow sketchybar borders starship
brew install --cask aerospace wezterm font-jetbrains-mono-nerd-font font-hack-nerd-font
stow -t ~ aerospace sketchybar borders wezterm starship wallpapers
echo 'eval "$(starship init zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc
brew services start sketchybar && open -a AeroSpace
osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to tell every desktop to set picture to "'"$HOME"'/.config/wallpapers/legacy-mountains.png"'
```
</details>

## Keybindings (AeroSpace)

Modifier is **Alt (Option)** — Cmd collides with macOS app shortcuts.

| Keys | Action |
|---|---|
| `Alt+Enter` | WezTerm |
| `Alt+b` / `Alt+n` / `Alt+c` / `Alt+m` | Launch/focus Chrome / VS Code / Slack / Music |
| `Alt+h/j/k/l` *or* `Alt+←/↓/↑/→` | Focus left/down/up/right |
| `Alt+Shift+h/j/k/l` *or* `Alt+Shift+←/↓/↑/→` | Move window |
| `Alt+1`…`0` | Switch to workspace 1–10 |
| `Alt+Shift+1`…`0` | Move window to workspace |
| `Ctrl+Alt+←/→` *or* `Ctrl+Alt+h/l` | Previous / next workspace (wraps) |
| `Alt+f` | Fullscreen |
| `Alt+e` | Toggle split orientation |
| `Alt+Shift+Space` | Toggle float |
| `Alt+w` | Close window |
| `Alt+r` | Resize mode (h/j/k/l, esc to exit) |
| `Alt+Shift+c` | Reload AeroSpace config |
| `Alt+Tab` | Last workspace |

Apps auto-route to workspaces on launch (Chrome→1, VS Code→2, Slack→3,
Notion→4, Music→5); Zoom floats. Edit/remove the `[[on-window-detected]]` blocks
in `aerospace.toml` to change this.

## Tuning

- **Bar overlaps windows / gap at top:** adjust `gaps.outer.top` in
  `aerospace/.config/aerospace/aerospace.toml`.
- **Switch WM modifier to Cmd:** find/replace `alt-` → `cmd-` in the same file.
- **Menu bar:** for the cleanest look, enable *System Settings → Control Center →
  Automatically hide and show the menu bar*.
- **SketchyBar shows percentages but no icons:** the font family name is wrong.
  Plugins reference `JetBrainsMono NF` (verify the real name with
  `system_profiler SPFontsDataType | grep JetBrains`). The palette/font live in
  `sketchybar/.config/sketchybar/colors.sh`, which every plugin sources — colours
  set inside a plugin are invisible (`0x0`) unless that file is sourced, because
  the SketchyBar daemon doesn't inherit `export`s from `sketchybarrc`.
- **Workspace dots:** the bar shows only workspaces that are focused or contain
  windows; empty ones are hidden (Hyprland-style). Logic in
  `sketchybar/.config/sketchybar/plugins/aerospace.sh`.
- **Raycast hotkey:** install sets it to `Option+Space`
  (`defaults write com.raycast.macos raycastGlobalHotkey "Option-49"`). If it
  reverts, set it in Raycast → Settings → General → Raycast Hotkey.
- **Wallpaper:** `wallpapers/.config/wallpapers/legacy-mountains.png`. Re-apply
  with the `osascript` line in the manual-install block above.
- **Bar modules:** left = workspaces · focused app · resize-mode pill · now
  playing; centre = clock; right = cpu · volume · battery · wifi. The `media`
  item only appears while Spotify/Music is playing (AppleScript, no extra deps);
  `wifi` shows the SSID, or the IP as a fallback. Add Bluetooth by installing
  `blueutil` and adding a plugin on the same pattern.
- **Wi-Fi shows IP instead of SSID:** modern macOS redacts the SSID from every
  CLI tool unless the caller has Location Services entitlement (a daemon-spawned
  plugin can't). Fix: make a Shortcut named **`CurrentWiFi`** whose only action is
  *Get Network Details → Network Name of Wi-Fi*, run it once to grant the location
  prompt, and `wifi.sh` will pick it up (it calls `shortcuts run "CurrentWiFi"`).
  Without the shortcut it falls back to the IP.
- **Touch Bar (BetterTouchTool):** on Touch Bar Macs, BTT shows tappable
  workspace pills 1–10 (active = mauve Catppuccin pill; tap to jump) in the app
  region, with the macOS Control Strip (brightness/volume) on the right. Built by
  `btt/touchbar-workspaces.py` via BTT's AppleScript API (idempotent — re-run to
  refresh; safe alongside your other BTT triggers). `install.sh` gates this on
  `pgrep TouchBarServer`, sets Touch Bar mode `appWithControlStrip`, and hides the
  app-region close button (`BTTHideTouchBarXButton`). BTT needs Accessibility
  permission + a (paid) license. Notes: SF-symbol/custom-font icons don't render
  on the bar, and BTT has no flexible spacer, so the system controls come from the
  native Control Strip rather than custom widgets. Adjust pill width via
  `BTTTouchBarButtonWidth` in the script.
- **macOS defaults:** `install.sh` also tunes key repeat (+ disables
  press-and-hold so keys repeat for vim), makes the Dock reveal instantly,
  redirects screenshots to `~/Pictures/Screenshots` (the Desktop is hidden), and
  applies Finder tweaks + Dark mode. Key-repeat changes fully apply to apps
  launched after the next login.
